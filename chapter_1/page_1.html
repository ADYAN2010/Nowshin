      <p>I still remember the first time I saw Nowshin ðŸŒ…. It wasnâ€™t dramatic or staged like in the movies; it was quiet, almost invisible if you werenâ€™t paying attention. But I noticed her immediately. Something about the way she moved, calm yet magnetic, pulled my eyes without me realizing it. It wasnâ€™t just her smile ðŸ˜„, though that could have stopped anyone in their tracks. It was the little, subtle things: the way she tucked a strand of hair behind her ear absentmindedly, the tiny tilt of her head when she was thinking, the way her laugh felt like sunlight spilling into a shadowed room. I didnâ€™t even know it at the time, but my mind started recording everything about her, storing each detail like they were precious treasures.

I remember the way her eyes caught the sunlight that day, glimmering in a way that felt unreal. It was almost like she carried her own kind of light, a quiet radiance that didnâ€™t need attention but demanded it anyway. I tried to focus on my own thoughts, but every little movement she made pulled my gaze back, hypnotic and unavoidable. I didnâ€™t realize then, but that was the very first sparkâ€”a subtle fire igniting deep inside my chest, one I couldnâ€™t see clearly yet but would feel burning for a long time ðŸŒ¸.</p>
