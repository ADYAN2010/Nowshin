      <p>I began to feel the slow, creeping weight of something I didn’t have a name for yet 💫. Every day I spent noticing her, thinking about her, imagining her, felt like pieces of a story I was only just beginning to write. And I realized that no matter what, this spark—this quiet, invisible fire—wasn’t going away. I wanted it to grow, to expand, to become something that would last a lifetime.

Even small, trivial moments mattered now. A laugh, a glance, a passing thought—it all carried meaning. She was quietly changing my world, and I welcomed it, fully aware that I could never go back to the way things were before her 🌍.</p>
