      <p>The first time she smiled at me, even briefly, it hit differently 😌. It wasn’t a “big moment” by any standard—just a soft, fleeting curve of her lips and a twinkle in her eyes—but it became a memory I’d replay over and over again. I memorized the way her lips moved, the sparkle in her gaze, the warmth that seemed to spread through me in that instant. That smile wasn’t just a smile; it was a statement, a whisper of connection that I felt even though I couldn’t explain it to anyone.

From that day, ordinary moments began changing subtly. Walking to class, drinking tea, listening to music, even waiting in line—I would catch myself thinking, what would she be doing right now? 🌞 My days began revolving around thoughts of her, and I didn’t even realize how deep I’d already fallen.</p>
