      <p>That was the first spark, the start of something I didn’t yet fully understand ✨💖. Even before I knew what “love” really meant, I knew it was hers, subtly, invisibly, and completely. Every smile, every word, every thought of her was like a seed planted deep in my chest. And I knew, somehow, that this was only the beginning—the first chapter of a story I wanted to write forever, a story that had no end as long as she existed in my world 💞.</p>
