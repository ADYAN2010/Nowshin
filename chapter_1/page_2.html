      <p>After that day, I kept thinking about her more than I wanted to admit ðŸ’­. At first, I told myself it was just curiosity or a passing crush, but it wasnâ€™t. Every time I saw her, I noticed details no one else seemed to: the way she laughed quietly to herself when remembering something funny, the soft hum she made when lost in thought, the way her hands moved when she was explaining something passionately. These small things werenâ€™t noticeable to most, but to me, they were everything.

Sitting in class, walking home, scrolling through my phoneâ€”her face, her laugh, her voice, kept finding its way into my thoughts.

Even imagining her voice made my chest tighten and my heart speed up ðŸ’“.</p>
