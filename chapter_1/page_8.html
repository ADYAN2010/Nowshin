      <p>The first spark wasnâ€™t dramatic. It wasnâ€™t fireworks or lightning bolts. It was quiet, subtle, and persistentâ€”a tiny flame that refused to die ðŸ”¥. I didnâ€™t even realize how much she had already entered my life, woven into my routine, shaping my days without ever being there physically. Every memory, every imagined conversation, every smile replayed in my headâ€”it was all part of something bigger, something unstoppable.

And I started noticing how even the smallest interactions, like her glancing around the room or brushing past someone, could make my chest tighten in ways I hadnâ€™t expected. Thatâ€™s when I knew: she had become unforgettable. Not because she demanded attention, but because she became indispensable to my thoughts, my feelings, my world ðŸŒ¸.</p>
